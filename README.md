# ESP8266-ArtikIntegration

Sample integration of an ESP8266 with Artik Cloud with voice control from Google Home



At the time of developing Artik Clouds Google Home integration only seems to support turn on/off and setLevel from Google Home.



Artik Cloud is capable of much more, but not through Google Home.
